# Mental-Block-Coding
This is a collection of short programs that I made that gave me some sort of immediate satisfaction.

## Calculator
This is a small calculator made in Python. It *SHOULD* be able to calculate whatever the user inputs in command line using MDAS.
In the future this could be changed to where it uses all the rules of PEMDAS if I ever decide to revisit.

## Palindrome
This just takes an input from the user and should return if the input was a palindrome or not.

## Listener
This allows the user to check traffic to localhost, though it could be changed to allow for input.
I could also add a way for the user to send packets.
This would make it so in multiple terminals you could send and recieve packets.

## ToDo List Application
This is a very simple (and ugly) webapp that allows the user to add a task and remove it
This could be made nicer with CSS, but that can come later
Also, storage of the tasks could be done too, which could be nice
Overall, there is a lot that can be done with this

## Deadfish Interpreter
This is a short chunk of code I wrote in C.
It takes a file in the command line and will read it assuming that it is written in the 'Deadfish' language.
This was pretty fun since I haven't worked with C in about a year, so it was a nice refresher for file io.
I might make other versions to get it nicer looking in the future.

## BrainF**k Interpreter
This is coming up next, and will also be in C.
